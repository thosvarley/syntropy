Syntropy Package
================

The ``syntropy`` package provides a suite of tools for information-theoretic analysis of complex systems and multivariate data.
Currently, the package includes estimators for both discrete and continuous (Gaussian) random variables.

You can find tutorial for the discrete and Gaussian estimators here:
